# What?
[ArtMap](https://gitlab.com/BlockStack/ArtMap) is a server plugin for Minecraft, and allows players to paint on a 32x32 canvas using an arbitrary set of colours. This tool converts an existing image (*.png, .jpg*, *etc.*) into one that conforms to the above rules.

# Why?
*'Limitation breeds creativity'*. But for those with less patience, this tool was developed to allow one to easily visualise how an image would look on an ArtMap canvas. The purpose of this tool, while niche, served as a brain-teaser for me to exercise my problem-solving skills on.

# How?
The program was written in simple Python, taking advantage of the [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) package to craft a UI for the user to interact with the program with.
